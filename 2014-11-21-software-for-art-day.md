# Software for Art Day 2014

This past Saturday [November 16th, 2014] I attended [Software For Artists Day (#S4AD)](softwareforartistsday.com), a one day event pertaining to all things at the intersection of software and art. The venue was one of my favorite places in all the world, [Pioneer Works](http://pioneerworks.org/). 

Every time I go to Pioneer Works there's something new to look at. When you walk into the building, you get a feel for the volume and scale of the space. It has this quality of simplicity that I love. When you're in the space, because it's so vast, have you the freedom to think. All of this, combined with great art or great discussion is really where the magic happens. Pioneer Works prides itself on being a center for art an innovation, all the while perched [right on the outskirts of Brooklyn in Red Hook](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Pioneer+Works/@40.679158,-74.012228,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x89c25a8a1abfdfb9:0xc48631e0fdda4d1c).

What I love is hearing other people's passion projects. Hearing what others are working on really inspires me. I'm trying to understand their process, searching for any explanation why they're doing what they're doing. I love hearing how they got to where they are, their past experience and learnings. My work is so digital and shapeless, I really appreciate people working with physical things. This was the mindset I had when I signed up for Software For Art Day, to learn more about the intersection of software and art.

One of my favorite talks was about, of all things sheet-metal. The talk was by [Jamie Zigelbaum](https://twitter.com/jamiezigelbaum). He spoke about his work ["Triangular Series"](http://www.jamiezigelbaum.com/#/triangular-series/), a mass of stalagmite-like shapes filled with sensors, raspberry pis and LEDs. His talk was about the benefits of using sheet-metal over 3D printing. I never thought about sheet-metal as a medium before and it seems really robust, simple to design, and cheap. For this project Zigelbaum wanted something strong, something that he would feel comfortable dangling over the heads of the people underneath. Then Then Zigelbaum gave a brief primer on SolidWorks the 3D modeling software. He made it look super easy to create a piece of metal. I love the idea that this digital thing could ordered easily and arrive as a physical product a couple of days later.

[Ariel Cotton](https://twitter.com/ericcorriel) was talking about Design and Interface. Design these days can mean many things. In her talk, Cotton listed out a slide for each "form" of design user experience design, user interface design, human-computer interaction, web design, industrial design, visual design, and product design. The thing I love about this list is how these all interesect with each other. For instance the "visual design", or branding for a company gets brought into the web design as perhaps a [style guide](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Style_guide).

Cotton also mentioned interface as magic. It's a really strong concenpt that I really love. She used the example of [Amazon's Mega Dropdown](http://bjk5.com/post/44698559168/breaking-down-amazons-mega-dropdown) to explain what a "magical" interface means to her, something smart, intuitive, solves a problem, or offers a good solution.

She laid out one of the best explanations of the loaded words "design" and "interface" I've ever heard. Then she brought both of these abstract concepts together in an amazing way that made complete sense. Here's a [link to her slides](http://www.slideshare.net/argoncobalt/physical-interaction-design?qid=a3a576bf-974a-4ed7-8135-adf3e8813fbe&v=qf1&b=&from_search=1), they're really great!

I was so conceptually captivated by a talk by [Eric Corriel](https://twitter.com/ericcorriel). He was driven by this urge to create a cube of light. His process was amazing. He has a time-lapse video of him experimenting with a whole bunch of different light sources, lasers and projectors. He made custom projector encasements that allowed for only a thin plane of light to escape. More about his project ["lightbox"](http://www.ericcorriel.com/art/lightbox/) over on his [website](http://www.ericcorriel.com).

It’s really amazing what people are doing. There are so many people using code to make a widget, a product, an artifact, something tangible. These projects create experiences for people, they’re emotional, memorable, they have a point, they invoke intention and purpose. After the event I feel inspired to inspire others, and very curious to learn more.

There's a ton of work that goes into planning an event like this. The whole thing was organized by the amazing, David Sheinkopf, the Director of Education at Pioneer Works. He also did a presentation titled "Sensors + Automation with Arduino", which I happened to catch a small bit of. I just wanted to say thanks to David along with all the presenters, volunteers, and organizers at Pioneer Works!
